# Branch Protection Configuration

**Created:** 2025-01-27  
**Status:** Ready for Implementation  
**Source:** Expert support pack recommendations

## Overview

This document outlines the recommended branch protection settings for the main branch to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

## Recommended Settings

### Required Status Checks
- ✅ `verify-aliases` - Ensures alias configuration is correct
- ✅ `type-check` - TypeScript strict type checking
- ✅ `lint` - ESLint with boundaries enforcement
- ✅ `build` - Successful build verification
- ✅ `test` - All tests passing
- ✅ `e2e` - End-to-end tests passing

### Additional Protection Rules
- ✅ **Require branches to be up to date before merging**
- ✅ **Require pull request reviews before merging** (1 reviewer minimum)
- ✅ **Dismiss stale reviews when new commits are pushed**
- ✅ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
- ✅ **Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100MB**

### Exceptions
- ❌ **Allow force pushes** - Disabled for security
- ❌ **Allow deletions** - Disabled for safety
- ❌ **Allow bypassing** - Disabled to enforce quality gates

## Implementation Steps

1. **Navigate to Repository Settings**
   - Go to GitHub repository
   - Click "Settings" tab
   - Click "Branches" in left sidebar

2. **Add Branch Protection Rule**
   - Click "Add rule" or "Add branch protection rule"
   - Set branch name pattern to `main`

3. **Configure Protection Settings**
   - Enable "Require a pull request before merging"
   - Enable "Require status checks to pass before merging"
   - Select all required status checks listed above
   - Enable "Require branches to be up to date before merging"
   - Enable "Require review from code owners"
   - Set "Required number of reviewers" to 1
   - Enable "Dismiss stale reviews when new commits are pushed"

4. **Save Configuration**
   - Click "Create" or "Save changes"
   - Verify the rule is active

## Benefits

- **Prevents broken builds** from reaching main branch
- **Enforces code quality** through automated checks
- **Maintains architectural boundaries** via ESLint rules
- **Ensures test coverage** before merging
- **Requires human review** for all changes
- **Prevents force pushes** that could bypass protections

## Monitoring

- Check GitHub Actions tab for CI status
- Review failed checks in pull requests
- Monitor branch protection status in repository settings
- Ensure all team members understand the protection rules

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Status checks not appearing**: Ensure CI workflow is properly configured
- **Bypass permissions**: Check repository admin settings
- **Review requirements**: Verify team member permissions

### Emergency Override
If emergency changes are needed:
1. Create a hotfix branch from main
2. Make minimal, targeted changes
3. Create PR with detailed explanation
4. Request expedited review from team lead
5. Merge only after all checks pass

**Note:** These settings should be implemented after the CI workflow is fully functional and all required status checks are passing consistently.
