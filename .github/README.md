## üéØ **Our Mission: Democratic Revolution**

> **"Citizens United broke democracy. We're fixing it."**

The Choices Platform is a **democratic equalizer** that levels the playing field for all candidates regardless of funding, exposes "bought off" politicians, and creates true accountability in our democracy.

### üèõÔ∏è **The Problem We're Solving**

- **Citizens United** created unlimited corporate spending in elections
- **Duopoly dominance** (Democratic/Republican) with massive funding advantages  
- **Independent/third-party candidates** can't compete financially
- **Voters** lack equal access to all candidates' voices
- **Incumbents** have massive advantages over challengers
- **"Bought off" politicians** vote against constituent interests

### üöÄ **Our Solution**

A **democratic equalizer platform** that:

1. **Levels the playing field** for all candidates regardless of funding
2. **Provides equal representation** for independent and third-party candidates  
3. **Exposes financial influence** and "bought off" politicians
4. **Enables direct constituent engagement** without financial barriers
5. **Creates accountability** through "walk the talk" analysis
6. **Protects user privacy** with zero-knowledge architecture
