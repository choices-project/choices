### **Security First**
- **All user data must be isolated** - users can never see other users' data
- **Only raw poll totals** are displayed - no individual vote data
- **RLS policies must be active** on all tables
- **Admin access is owner-only** - hardcoded user ID

### **Documentation Quality**
- **Keep documentation updated** as you make changes
- **Use clear titles** that indicate content and purpose
- **Add cross-references** to related documents
- **Update status indicators** (✅ Complete, 🔄 In Progress, ⚠️ Needs Attention)
