- All tables, views, functions, and enums
- Generated by Supabase CLI from live database
- Includes all RLS policies and database functions

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This archive serves several important purposes:

### **Historical Reference**
- **Schema Evolution**: Track how the database schema evolved
- **Type Changes**: Understand changes in type definitions
- **Migration History**: Reference for database migrations
- **Development Context**: Understand development decisions

### **Troubleshooting**
- **Type Issues**: Reference for resolving type conflicts
- **Schema Problems**: Compare current vs historical schema
- **Migration Issues**: Debug migration problems
- **Development Context**: Understand why certain types exist

---

## 🚀 Current Type System

The current Choices platform uses a **modular type system** located in:
- **`web/types/database.ts`**: Core database types
- **`web/types/core/`**: Core system types
- **`web/types/features/`**: Feature-specific types
- **`web/types/external/`**: External API types

### **Benefits of Current System**
- **Modular**: Organized by feature and purpose
- **Maintainable**: Easy to update and modify
- **Type-Safe**: Comprehensive TypeScript coverage
- **Documented**: Well-documented with JSDoc comments

---

## 📚 When to Use Archived Types

### **Reference Only**
- Understanding historical schema decisions
- Debugging type-related issues
- Comparing current vs historical types
- Understanding migration requirements

### **Not for Current Development**
- Don't use for current implementation
- Don't reference for current type definitions
- Don't use for current development practices
- Don't use for current maintenance

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

### **Supabase-Generated Types**
- These were generated by Supabase CLI
- May not reflect current database state
- Use for historical reference only
- Don't use for current development

### **Current Type System**
- Use current modular type system
- Located in `web/types/` directory
- Actively maintained and updated
- Use for all current development

---

## 🔧 Migration Notes

### **From Supabase-Generated to Modular**
The platform migrated from Supabase-generated types to a modular type system because:

1. **Better Organization**: Types organized by feature and purpose
2. **Easier Maintenance**: Easier to update and modify
3. **Better Documentation**: Comprehensive JSDoc comments
4. **Type Safety**: Better TypeScript coverage and safety
5. **Development Experience**: Better developer experience

### **Key Changes**
- **Modular Structure**: Types organized by feature
- **Custom Definitions**: Custom type definitions instead of generated
- **Better Documentation**: Comprehensive JSDoc comments
- **Type Safety**: Enhanced TypeScript coverage

**Archive Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: October 27, 2025  
**Status**: 📦 Archived for Reference
