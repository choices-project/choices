# Unimplemented Features Audit

**Created:** January 27, 2025  
**Updated:** January 27, 2025  
**Status:** Active Audit

## Overview

This document tracks unimplemented features and incomplete implementations found during the linting cleanup process. These items should be prioritized for proper implementation rather than being left as mock implementations or incomplete code.

## High Priority - Security & Core Functionality

### 1. Zero-Knowledge Proofs Implementation
**File:** `web/modules/advanced-privacy/zero-knowledge-proofs.ts`

**Issues Found:**
- All proof generation methods return mock data (`mock: true`)
- Verification methods use basic structural checks instead of cryptographic verification
- Missing actual cryptographic implementations for:
  - Schnorr signatures
  - Range proofs (Bulletproofs)
  - Membership proofs
  - Equality proofs
  - Age verification proofs
  - Vote verification proofs

**Impact:** High - This is a core privacy feature that's currently non-functional

**Recommendation:** Implement proper cryptographic libraries or mark as experimental/disabled

### 2. Encryption/Decryption Security Issues
**File:** `web/utils/privacy/data-management.ts`

**Issues Found:**
- ✅ **FIXED:** IV (Initialization Vector) was not being stored/retrieved properly
- ✅ **FIXED:** Decryption was using hardcoded IV instead of stored IV

**Status:** Fixed during audit

## Medium Priority - Data Integrity & Testing

### 3. Database Test Infrastructure
**File:** `web/scripts/test-dbt-tests.ts`

**Issues Found:**
- ✅ **FIXED:** Test queries were fetching data but not using it for validation
- Test results were not being properly validated

**Status:** Fixed during audit

### 4. Production Readiness Testing
**File:** `web/scripts/test-production-readiness.ts`

**Issues Found:**
- ✅ **FIXED:** Contact count queries were not using the returned data
- Missing validation of actual data availability

**Status:** Fixed during audit

### 5. Bundle Optimization Strategy
**File:** `web/utils/bundle-optimization.ts`

**Issues Found:**
- ✅ **FIXED:** Generated recommendations were not being used in optimization strategy
- Strategy was hardcoded instead of using analysis results

**Status:** Fixed during audit

## Low Priority - Development Tools

### 6. WebAuthn Error Handling
**File:** `web/lib/webauthn/error-handling.ts`

**Issues Found:**
- Console statements should be replaced with proper logging
- Error logging could be more structured

**Recommendation:** Replace console statements with structured logging

### 7. Vote Finalization System
**File:** `web/lib/vote/finalize.ts`

**Issues Found:**
- ✅ **FIXED:** Console statements replaced with proper logger
- Some TypeScript errors remain (Supabase query builder types)

**Status:** Partially fixed - TypeScript errors need attention

## Unimplemented Features Requiring Implementation

### 1. Zero-Knowledge Proof System
**Priority:** Critical
**Effort:** High
**Description:** Complete cryptographic implementation of ZK proofs

**Options:**
- Implement using existing libraries (e.g., circom, snarkjs)
- Mark as experimental and disable in production
- Create simplified but functional implementations

### 2. Advanced Privacy Features
**Priority:** Medium
**Effort:** Medium
**Description:** Complete the privacy module implementations

**Features to implement:**
- Differential privacy calculations
- Zero-knowledge proof verification
- Privacy-preserving analytics

### 3. Comprehensive Error Handling
**Priority:** Medium
**Effort:** Low
**Description:** Replace remaining console statements with structured logging

**Files to update:**
- `web/lib/webauthn/error-handling.ts`
- Any remaining console statements in production code

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next Sprint)
1. **Disable or mark ZK proofs as experimental** - Current mock implementations could be misleading
2. **Fix remaining TypeScript errors** in vote finalization system
3. **Complete error handling migration** from console to structured logging

### Medium-term Actions (Next 2-3 Sprints)
1. **Implement proper ZK proof system** or remove from production code
2. **Add comprehensive testing** for privacy features
3. **Implement proper cryptographic key management**

### Long-term Actions (Next Quarter)
1. **Security audit** of all privacy-related code
2. **Performance optimization** of cryptographic operations
3. **Documentation** of privacy features and their limitations

## Notes

- All "unused variable" issues have been properly addressed by implementing the missing functionality
- Console statements in script files are appropriate and should remain
- Client-side console statements for debugging are acceptable
- Server-side console statements should be replaced with structured logging

## Files Modified During Audit

- `web/modules/advanced-privacy/zero-knowledge-proofs.ts` - Fixed error handling and parameter usage
- `web/scripts/test-dbt-tests.ts` - Fixed unused variables by implementing proper validation
- `web/scripts/test-production-readiness.ts` - Fixed unused variables by implementing proper data usage
- `web/utils/bundle-optimization.ts` - Fixed unused variables by implementing proper recommendation usage
- `web/utils/privacy/data-management.ts` - Fixed critical security issues with IV handling
- `web/lib/vote/finalize.ts` - Replaced console statements with proper logging
- `web/lib/webauthn/credential-verification.ts` - Replaced console statements with devLog
- Various config files - Fixed unused parameters
