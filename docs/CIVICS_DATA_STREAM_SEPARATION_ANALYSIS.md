# Civics Data Stream Separation Analysis

**Created:** December 31, 2024  
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-02  
**Status:** Current Implementation Review & Phase 2 Planning  
**Focus:** Data Stream Isolation & Best Practices

## 🎯 Current Architecture Analysis

### ✅ **Clean Separation Achieved**

#### **Package Structure Isolation**
```
choices-monorepo/
├── apps/
│   └── ingest/           # ETL workers and data processing ONLY
├── packages/
│   ├── civics-schemas/   # Shared type definitions

└── infra/               # Infrastructure configs
```

#### **Import Flow Analysis**
- ✅ **Web → Civics Sources:** Clean imports via `@choices/civics-sources/*`
- ✅ **No Reverse Flow:** Civics sources don't import from web
- ✅ **Shared Schemas:** Type definitions shared via `@choices/civics-schemas`
- ✅ **No User Data in Civics:** Civics packages contain no user authentication or profile logic

### 🔍 **Current Data Flow**

#### **Civics Data Stream (Read-Only)**
```
External APIs → @choices/civics-sources → Web API Routes → Frontend
```

#### **User Data Stream (Separate)**
```
User Input → Web API Routes → Supabase Auth → User Profiles
```

## 🚨 **Critical Separation Points**

### **1. Authentication Boundaries**
- **Civics APIs:** No authentication required for public data
- **User APIs:** Full authentication and authorization
- **No Cross-Contamination:** Civics data never requires user credentials

### **2. Data Ownership**
- **Civics Data:** Public, government-sourced information
- **User Data:** Private, user-generated content
- **Clear Ownership:** No mixing of public and private data streams

### **3. API Endpoint Separation**
- **Public Civics:** `/api/district`, `/api/candidates/*`
- **User-Specific:** `/api/auth/*`, `/api/user/*`, `/api/profile/*`
- **No Overlap:** Clear endpoint naming conventions

## 🤔 **Best Practices Questions**

### **Architecture & Separation**

1. **Package Boundaries:**
   - Should we create separate `@choices/civics-server` and `@choices/civics-client` packages?
   - Do we need a `@choices/user-management` package for user-specific logic?
   - Should we implement a clear "boundary layer" between civics and user data?

2. **Database Schema Separation:**
   - Should civics data use a separate database/schema from user data?
   - Do we need different connection pools for civics vs user operations?
   - How should we handle data that references both (e.g., user-saved candidates)?

3. **Caching Strategy:**
   - Should civics data and user data use separate cache namespaces?
   - Do we need different TTL strategies for public vs private data?
   - How should we handle cache invalidation across streams?

### **Security & Privacy**

4. **Data Access Patterns:**
   - Should civics data be cached differently for authenticated vs anonymous users?
   - Do we need rate limiting strategies that differentiate between data streams?
   - How should we handle data that becomes user-specific (e.g., saved districts)?

5. **API Security:**
   - Should civics endpoints have different CORS policies than user endpoints?
   - Do we need separate API key management for civics vs user operations?
   - How should we handle mixed endpoints (e.g., user preferences for civics display)?

### **Performance & Scalability**

6. **Load Balancing:**
   - Should civics and user APIs be deployed to different infrastructure?
   - Do we need separate CDN strategies for public vs private data?
   - How should we handle traffic spikes that affect both streams?

7. **Monitoring & Observability:**
   - Should we have separate metrics and alerting for civics vs user operations?
   - Do we need different logging strategies for public vs private data access?
   - How should we track performance across the boundary layer?

## 🚀 **Phase 2 Implementation Questions**

### **Real Data Integration**

8. **External API Management:**
   - Should we implement separate API key rotation for each external service?
   - Do we need different retry/fallback strategies for each data source?
   - How should we handle API rate limits that affect user experience?

9. **Data Validation & Quality:**
   - Should we implement different validation rules for external vs user data?
   - Do we need separate data quality monitoring for each stream?
   - How should we handle data inconsistencies between sources?

10. **Caching & Performance:**
    - Should we implement different cache warming strategies for civics vs user data?
    - Do we need separate performance budgets for each data stream?
    - How should we handle cache misses that affect user experience?

### **Trust Tier Integration**

11. **Data Access by Trust Level:**
    - Should different trust tiers have access to different civics data?
    - Do we need separate rate limits for each trust tier?
    - How should we handle data that becomes available at higher trust tiers?

12. **User-Civics Interaction:**
    - Should users be able to save/favorite civics data?
    - Do we need separate storage for user-civics interactions?
    - How should we handle data that becomes user-specific?

### **Advanced Features**

13. **Issue Tracking Integration:**
    - Should issue tracking be part of civics data or user data?
    - Do we need separate APIs for public vs user-specific issue data?
    - How should we handle user-generated issue content?

14. **Analytics & Insights:**
    - Should we have separate analytics for civics vs user interactions?
    - Do we need different privacy considerations for each data stream?
    - How should we handle analytics that cross both streams?
