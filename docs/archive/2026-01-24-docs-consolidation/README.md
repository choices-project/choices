# Archived docs — 2026-01-24 consolidation

Outdated or redundant documentation moved here to reduce confusion. Use the **canonical** set in `docs/` as the source of truth.

## What was archived

| File | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `AGENT_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` | Completion checklist; superseded by `docs/AGENT_SETUP.md` |
| `AGENT_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` | Historical implementation summary; agents use skills + `AGENT_SETUP` |
| `AGENT_SKILLS_MCP_REMAINING_WORK.md` | Tracker mostly done; setup lives in `AGENT_SETUP` |
| `APPLY_SECURITY_FIX.md` | One-off fix instructions; security fixes applied |
| `SECURITY_ADVISOR_WARNINGS_ANALYSIS.md` | Post–Security Advisor review analysis; retained for reference |
| `SECURITY_ADVISOR_REVIEW_GUIDE.md` | Review process guide; work complete |
| `SECURITY_ADVISOR_VERIFICATION_QUERIES.sql` | Verification queries; use with archived analysis if needed |

## Where to look now

- **Agent setup (skills, MCP):** `docs/AGENT_SETUP.md`
- **Security:** `docs/SECURITY.md`; historical Security Advisor material also in `archive/reference/security-advisor-2026-01/`
