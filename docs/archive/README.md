# Archived Documentation Index

This directory contains legacy documentation that has been superseded by the refreshed November 2025 doc set. Files are retained for historical context but should not be treated as source of truth.

```
docs/archive/
├─ legacy-status/           # Outdated status reports & feature rundowns
├─ release-notes/           # One-off status memos and completion announcements
├─ reference/               # Miscellaneous guides (see civics/, guides/, testing/)
└─ runbooks/                # Operational playbooks and emergency procedures
```

When archiving additional documents:
1. Move the markdown file into the appropriate subdirectory.
2. Add a short note here if the directory structure changes.
3. Update `docs/README.md` so the primary index remains accurate.

If the archived file still contains useful technical insight, consider extracting the relevant pieces into the active docs before archiving.

### Archived-in-place (to preserve inbound links)

- `docs/ROADMAP.md` — Marked as [ARCHIVED] and points to `docs/ROADMAP_SINGLE_SOURCE.md`. Kept in place to avoid breaking links; do not add new items.
