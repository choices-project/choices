4. **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error handling patterns
5. **Monitoring Setup** - Proactive monitoring from day one

### **✅ Do These Early (Priority 2)**
1. **API Design** - Design APIs before building features
2. **Testing Strategy** - Write tests as you build
3. **Documentation** - Document as you go
4. **Performance Optimization** - Optimize from the start
5. **Code Quality** - Maintain high standards

### **✅ Do These Regularly (Priority 3)**
1. **Code Reviews** - Regular review process
2. **Performance Monitoring** - Monitor and optimize
3. **Security Audits** - Regular security checks
4. **Documentation Updates** - Keep docs current
5. **Team Communication** - Regular syncs and updates

## 🚨 **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**

### **❌ Don't Do These**
- [ ] Start coding without database design
- [ ] Ignore TypeScript errors
