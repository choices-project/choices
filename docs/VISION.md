# Choices Platform Vision

_Last updated: January 2026_

## Mission

Choices is a privacy-first, open-source platform for participatory democracy that enables citizens to engage with polls, representatives, and civic actions in a transparent, accessible, and accountable way.

## Core Principles

1. **Privacy First** - User control over data, GDPR/CCPA compliant
2. **Equal Voting** - "A vote is a vote. Period." - No weighted votes in results
3. **Open Source** - Transparent and auditable codebase
4. **Accessibility** - Inclusive design for all users
5. **Performance** - Fast, reliable, and offline-capable

## MVP Status (Complete)

The Choices platform MVP is **complete and production-ready**. All core features are implemented, tested, and documented.

## Future Roadmap

While the MVP is complete, the platform continues to evolve. Future work is tracked in:

- **Feature Status**: [`FEATURE_STATUS.md`](FEATURE_STATUS.md) - Current feature flags and their states
- **Roadmap**: `scratch/ROADMAP_SINGLE_SOURCE.md` - Detailed outstanding work items
- **Current Status**: [`CURRENT_STATUS.md`](CURRENT_STATUS.md) - Active workstreams and known gaps

### Planned Enhancements (Not Blocking MVP)
