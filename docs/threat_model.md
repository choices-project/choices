# Threat Model (STRIDE-lite)

- Bots/Sybils → mitigated by passkeys, device integrity, issuance rate limits.
- Operator malfeasance → mitigated by public commitments, reproducible tally, independent mirrors.
- De-anonymization → IA/PO split, per-poll tags, minimal logs, DP on analytics.
- Coercion → receipts prove inclusion, not choice; delay disclosures where needed.
