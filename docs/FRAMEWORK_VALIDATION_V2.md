This file is used to validate our comprehensive AI agent management framework with the corrected policy.

## Purpose
- Test the updated owner limits (unlimited for setup)
- Validate date mandate enforcement
- Ensure all CI workflows function correctly

## Framework Features Being Tested
- ✅ Dynamic limits (AI vs Owner) - Owner now unlimited
- ✅ Content-aware date validation
- ✅ Hot files policy enforcement
- ✅ Forbidden imports detection
- ✅ Trust-tier policy enforcement
- ✅ Performance optimization
- ✅ Security automation

## Expected Results
- ✅ Owner LOC limit should pass (unlimited)
- ✅ Date validation should pass (2025-09-02)
- ✅ All other checks should pass
- ✅ Framework should be fully functional

## Notes
- This test uses the corrected agent policy
- Owner limits temporarily increased for setup
- Will reduce limits after framework is validated
