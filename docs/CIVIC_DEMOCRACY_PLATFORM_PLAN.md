# Civic Democracy Platform - Comprehensive Implementation Plan

**Created:** December 31, 2024  
**Status:** Planning Phase - Awaiting Stable Build Foundation  
**Priority:** Phase 2 (After stable auth system is complete)

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the complete architecture and implementation plan for transforming the Choices platform into a comprehensive civic democracy platform designed to break the duopoly by providing voters with real, localized information about candidates and issues in their specific electoral districts.
