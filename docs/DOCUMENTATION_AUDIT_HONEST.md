# Documentation Audit - Honest Assessment

**Date**: November 3, 2025  
**Status**: 🔴 NEEDS WORK - Structure fixed, content outdated

---

## 🎯 Truth

I consolidated the STRUCTURE but didn't update the CONTENT to reflect current reality.

### What I Did
✅ Organized files into clean hierarchy
✅ Removed `/web/docs` confusion
✅ Archived historical work
✅ Created logical structure

### What I Didn't Do
❌ Update outdated content (many docs from January 2025)
❌ Verify accuracy against current codebase
❌ Remove truly obsolete docs
❌ Ensure all information is current

---

## 🔴 Outdated Docs Found

- `API_DOCUMENTATION_CIVICS.md` - Last updated January 29, 2025
- `DEVELOPER_GUIDE_SUPABASE_CLIENT.md` - Last updated January 29, 2025
- Likely others with old dates

---

## ✅ What Should Actually Be in /docs

### Essential & Current (Need to create/update)
1. **README.md** - Index (CREATED, current)
2. **CURRENT_STATUS.md** - November 3 status (CURRENT ✅)
3. **DATABASE_SCHEMA.md** - November 3 migrations (CURRENT ✅)
4. **FEATURES.md** - Current features (CREATED, current ✅)
5. **DEVELOPMENT.md** - Setup guide (CREATED, current ✅)
6. **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Standards (exists, need to verify)
7. **LINT_STANDARDS.md** - Current standards (CURRENT ✅)

### Need to Verify/Update or Remove
- `API_DOCUMENTATION_CIVICS.md` - January 2025, verify still accurate
- `DEVELOPER_GUIDE_SUPABASE_CLIENT.md` - January 2025, verify pattern still used
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Copied from archive, verify current
- `SECURITY.md` - Copied from archive, verify current
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Merged old docs, verify current
- `ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md` - Verify complete list

## 🎯 Honest Next Steps

1. Audit each core doc for accuracy against codebase
2. Update or remove if outdated
3. Verify subdirectory docs (features/, guides/)
4. Ensure everything reflects November 2025 state

**Current docs are ORGANIZED but not yet ACCURATE.**
