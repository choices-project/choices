|----------|------|------|------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Option A | ...  | ...  | Low/Med/High| X weeks          | Low/Med/High     |
| Option B | ...  | ...  | Low/Med/High| X weeks          | Low/Med/High     |
| Option C | ...  | ...  | Low/Med/High| X weeks          | Low/Med/High     |

#### **Implementation Roadmap**

- ✅ Validate performance
- ✅ Security testing
- ✅ User acceptance testing

## 🏗️ **Implementation Best Practices**

### **1. Database-First Approach**

- ✅ Consider data integrity
- ✅ Plan for scalability
- ✅ Document relationships

### **2. Security-First Development**

### **3. API-First Design**
- ✅ Design API contracts first
- ✅ Document endpoints thoroughly
- ✅ Plan error handling
- ✅ Consider rate limiting
- ✅ Version management strategy

## 🔄 **Systematic Problem-Solving Framework**

### **When Facing Issues:**

#### **1. Root Cause Analysis (MANDATORY)**
```markdown
❌ DON'T: Apply quick fixes
❌ DON'T: Remove components without understanding their purpose
❌ DON'T: Assume simple solutions to complex architectural issues
✅ DO: Investigate underlying causes
✅ DO: Understand component relationships and dependencies
✅ DO: Fix the actual problem, not symptoms

Questions to ask:
- What is the fundamental problem?
- Why did this happen?
- What is the purpose of this component in the architecture?
- What dependencies will be broken if I remove this?
- How can we prevent this in the future?
```

#### **2. Solution Evaluation Matrix**
| Solution | Effectiveness | Implementation Time | Risk | Long-term Impact |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|------|------------------|
| Quick Fix | Low          | Fast              | High | Negative         |
| Proper Fix | High         | Medium            | Low  | Positive         |
| Refactor  | Very High    | Slow              | Low  | Very Positive    |

#### **3. Decision Framework**
- ✅ If issue affects core functionality → Fix properly
- ✅ If issue is cosmetic → Document for later
- ✅ If issue reveals architectural flaw → Refactor
- ✅ If issue is user-facing → Prioritize

## 🚫 **Anti-Patterns to Avoid**

### **1. Quick Fix Syndrome**
```markdown
❌ DON'T: Apply band-aid solutions
❌ DON'T: Ignore underlying problems
❌ DON'T: Skip testing
❌ DON'T: Rush implementation
❌ DON'T: Remove architectural components without understanding their purpose
❌ DON'T: Assume simple solutions to complex security or architectural issues
```

### **2. Infinite Loop Patterns**
```markdown
❌ DON'T: Keep trying the same approach
❌ DON'T: Ignore error messages
❌ DON'T: Skip research phase
❌ DON'T: Assume simple solutions
```

### **3. Scope Creep**
```markdown
❌ DON'T: Add features without planning
❌ DON'T: Change requirements mid-implementation
❌ DON'T: Skip validation checkpoints
❌ DON'T: Ignore user feedback
```
