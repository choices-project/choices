## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive review of the Choices platform's voting engine system following a complete TypeScript refactoring that eliminated all `any` types and resolved linting errors. The voting engine is a sophisticated, multi-strategy system supporting five different voting methods with comprehensive validation, processing, and audit capabilities.

## System Architecture Overview

### Core Components

The voting engine consists of the following key components:

1. **VoteEngine** (`engine.ts`) - Main orchestrator
2. **VoteProcessor** (`processor.ts`) - Vote storage and database operations
3. **VoteValidator** (`validator.ts`) - Comprehensive validation logic
4. **IRVCalculator** (`irv-calculator.ts`) - Instant Runoff Voting calculations
5. **FinalizeManager** (`finalize.ts`) - Poll finalization and snapshot creation
6. **Voting Strategies** (`strategies/`) - Method-specific implementations

### Supported Voting Methods

1. **Single Choice** - Traditional first-past-the-post voting
2. **Approval Voting** - Multiple candidate approval
3. **Ranked Choice (IRV)** - Instant Runoff Voting with elimination rounds
4. **Quadratic Voting** - Weighted voting with credit constraints
5. **Range Voting** - Score-based voting within defined ranges
