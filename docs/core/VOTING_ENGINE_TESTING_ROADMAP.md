## 📝 **Notes & Observations**

### **Current Status**
- ✅ **IRVCalculator**: Core logic working, interface alignment needed
- ✅ **VoteProcessor**: Core functionality working, mock setup needed
- ✅ **FinalizeManager**: Adapter methods added, mock setup needed

### **Key Insights**
- Mock setup issues are the primary blocker (not core logic problems)
- Golden test cases need interface alignment (not algorithm problems)
- Core voting engine functionality is solid and working correctly

### **Next Steps**
1. Start with Phase 1.1 (IRVCalculator golden test cases)
2. Move to Phase 1.2 (VoteProcessor mock setup)
3. Complete Phase 1.3 (FinalizeManager mock setup)
4. Begin Phase 2 (Integration tests)

## 🚀 **Ready to Start?**

**Current Priority**: Fix IRVCalculator golden test cases  
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours  
**Expected Outcome**: 31/31 IRVCalculator tests passing

Let's get started! 🎯
