# Security Policy

**Created:** September 13, 2025  
**Updated:** September 13, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION**

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security Overview**

The Choices platform implements a comprehensive, multi-layer security architecture designed to protect user data, ensure system integrity, and maintain privacy-first principles. Our security approach covers everything from pre-commit hooks to production monitoring.

## üîí **Multi-Layer Security Architecture**

### **1. Pre-Commit Security (Local Development)**
- **Context-Aware Scanning** - Advanced security scanning that distinguishes between code patterns and actual secrets
- **Comprehensive Pattern Detection** - JWT tokens, API keys, database URLs, Supabase keys, UUIDs, hex strings
- **False Positive Prevention** - Intelligent filtering to avoid blocking legitimate code patterns
- **File Type Protection** - Blocks .env files, credential files, database files from being committed

### **2. CI/CD Security (GitHub Actions)**
- **Secret Detection** - gitleaks integration for comprehensive secret scanning
- **Code Analysis** - CodeQL for static security analysis
- **Dependency Scanning** - OSV scanner for vulnerability detection
- **Security Audits** - Automated npm audit with high/critical severity blocking
- **Type Safety** - Strict TypeScript compilation with zero tolerance for errors

### **3. Application Security**
- **Authentication** - Supabase Auth with multi-factor support
- **Authorization** - Row Level Security (RLS) policies for database access
- **Input Validation** - Comprehensive input sanitization and validation
- **Rate Limiting** - API protection against abuse and DoS attacks
- **CORS Protection** - Proper cross-origin resource sharing configuration

### **4. Infrastructure Security**
- **HTTPS Enforcement** - All communications encrypted in transit
- **Environment Variables** - Secure management of secrets and configuration
- **Database Security** - PostgreSQL with RLS policies and secure connections
- **Deployment Security** - Vercel with proper environment isolation

## üö® **Vulnerability Reporting**

### **How to Report**
- **Email**: security@choices-platform.org
- **GitHub Issues**: Use the "Security" label for non-critical issues
- **Coordinated Disclosure**: 90 days by default for critical vulnerabilities

### **Response Process**
1. **Acknowledgment** - Within 24 hours
2. **Assessment** - Within 72 hours
3. **Resolution** - Within 90 days for critical issues
4. **Disclosure** - Coordinated public disclosure after resolution

## üîê **Key Management**

### **Production Keys**
- **Cloud KMS/HSM** - All production keys managed via cloud key management
- **Key Rotation** - Automated key rotation policies
- **Public Key Transparency** - Transparency logs for public key verification
- **Environment Isolation** - Keys isolated by environment (dev/staging/prod)

### **Development Keys**
- **Local Environment** - Development keys in .env.local (never committed)
- **Example Keys** - Placeholder keys in documentation
- **Key Validation** - Pre-commit hooks prevent real keys in code

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security Features**

### **Authentication & Authorization**
- **Multi-Factor Authentication** - Email, OAuth (biometric planned for future)
- **Session Management** - Secure JWT token handling
- **Role-Based Access** - Granular permission system
- **Account Protection** - Brute force protection and account locking

### **Data Protection**
- **Encryption at Rest** - Database encryption with Supabase
- **Encryption in Transit** - HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- **Privacy by Design** - Minimal data collection and retention
- **GDPR Compliance** - Privacy-first architecture

### **Code Security**
- **Type Safety** - Comprehensive TypeScript implementation
- **Input Validation** - All inputs validated and sanitized
- **SQL Injection Prevention** - Parameterized queries and RLS
- **XSS Protection** - Content Security Policy and input sanitization

## üîç **Security Monitoring**

### **Automated Monitoring**
- **Pre-commit Hooks** - Real-time security scanning during development
- **CI Security Checks** - Automated security validation on every PR
- **Dependency Scanning** - Continuous vulnerability monitoring
- **Performance Monitoring** - Real-time system health monitoring

### **Manual Security Reviews**
- **Code Reviews** - Security-focused code review process
- **Architecture Reviews** - Regular security architecture assessments
- **Penetration Testing** - Periodic security testing
- **Compliance Audits** - Regular compliance verification

## üìã **Security Checklist**

### **Development Security**
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks installed and working
- [ ] No secrets in code or configuration
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Error handling doesn't leak information
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date

### **Deployment Security**
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured
- [ ] HTTPS enforced
- [ ] Database connections secured

## üöÄ **Security Best Practices**

### **For Developers**
1. **Never commit secrets** - Use environment variables
2. **Validate all inputs** - Sanitize and validate user data
3. **Use secure defaults** - Implement secure-by-default configurations
4. **Keep dependencies updated** - Regular security updates
5. **Follow the principle of least privilege** - Minimal necessary permissions

### **For Administrators**
1. **Regular security audits** - Monthly security reviews
2. **Monitor access logs** - Track and analyze access patterns
3. **Update systems regularly** - Keep all systems patched
4. **Backup and recovery** - Test backup and recovery procedures
5. **Incident response** - Maintain incident response procedures
