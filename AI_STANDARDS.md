# AI Development Standards for Choices Platform

## üéØ **Core Principles**

### **1. Version Control First**
- **ALWAYS** create feature branches for major changes
- **NEVER** commit directly to main/master
- **ALWAYS** wait for CI/CD pipeline completion
- **MONITOR** pull request status and address failures before merging
- **USE** conventional commit messages: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`

### **2. Root Cause Analysis**
- **IDENTIFY** the underlying problem, not just symptoms
- **AVOID** quick fixes unless troubleshooting requires immediate resolution
- **DOCUMENT** why a quick fix was necessary and plan for proper solution
- **INVESTIGATE** before implementing solutions
- **TEST** assumptions before making changes

### **3. Systematic Problem Solving**
- **ANALYZE** the complete context before making changes
- **RESEARCH** existing solutions and best practices
- **PLAN** implementation steps before coding
- **VALIDATE** each step before proceeding
- **DOCUMENT** decisions and rationale

### **4. Quality Assurance**
- **REVIEW** code before committing
- **TEST** functionality after changes
- **VERIFY** integration points
- **CHECK** for breaking changes
- **ENSURE** backward compatibility when possible

## üîÑ **Development Workflow**

### **Feature Development Process**
1. **Create Branch**: `git checkout -b feature/user-authentication`
2. **Implement Changes**: Make focused, atomic commits
3. **Test Locally**: Verify functionality before pushing
4. **Push Branch**: `git push origin feature/user-authentication`
5. **Create PR**: Use descriptive title and detailed description
6. **Monitor CI/CD**: Wait for all checks to pass
7. **Address Issues**: Fix any failures in the PR
8. **Get Review**: Request code review if applicable
9. **Merge**: Only after all checks pass and review approved

### **Bug Fix Process**
1. **Reproduce**: Confirm the issue exists
2. **Investigate**: Find root cause, not just symptoms
3. **Create Branch**: `git checkout -b fix/authentication-issue`
4. **Implement Fix**: Address root cause when possible
5. **Test Fix**: Verify the issue is resolved
6. **Document**: Explain what was fixed and why
7. **Create PR**: Include reproduction steps and fix details
8. **Monitor**: Ensure fix doesn't introduce new issues

## üö® **Problem-Solving Guidelines**

### **When to Use Quick Fixes**
- **CI/CD Pipeline Failures**: Immediate fixes to unblock deployment
- **Security Issues**: Critical vulnerabilities requiring immediate attention
- **Production Outages**: Service disruptions affecting users
- **Data Loss Prevention**: Issues that could cause data corruption

### **When to Do Root Cause Analysis**
- **Recurring Issues**: Problems that keep happening
- **Performance Problems**: Slow response times or resource usage
- **Integration Failures**: Issues between components
- **User Experience Problems**: UI/UX issues affecting usability
- **Architecture Issues**: Fundamental design problems

### **Infinite Loop Prevention**
- **Set Time Limits**: Maximum 3 attempts for the same approach
- **Change Strategy**: If stuck, try a different approach
- **Ask for Help**: Document the issue and seek guidance
- **Break Down**: Split complex problems into smaller parts
- **Step Back**: Review the problem from a different angle

## üìã **Code Quality Standards**

### **Before Committing**
- [ ] Code compiles without errors
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No linting errors
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] Changes are focused and atomic
- [ ] Commit message is descriptive

### **Before Pushing**
- [ ] All local tests pass
- [ ] Code has been reviewed
- [ ] Integration points tested
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] No sensitive data in commits

### **Before Merging**
- [ ] All CI/CD checks pass
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] No merge conflicts
- [ ] Feature tested in staging
- [ ] Rollback plan documented

## üîç **Monitoring and Debugging**

### **CI/CD Pipeline Monitoring**
- **Watch Build Status**: Monitor all stages of the pipeline
- **Check Test Results**: Ensure all tests pass
- **Review Linting**: Fix any code style issues
- **Verify Deployment**: Confirm successful deployment
- **Monitor Logs**: Check for errors in production

### **Issue Tracking**
- **Document Problems**: Record issues with reproduction steps
- **Track Solutions**: Document what worked and what didn't
- **Learn from Failures**: Use failures to improve processes
- **Share Knowledge**: Help other contributors avoid similar issues

## üõ†Ô∏è **Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid**

### **‚ùå Don't Do This**
- Commit directly to main branch
- Push broken code to fix later
- Ignore CI/CD failures
- Make large, unfocused changes
- Skip testing before pushing
- Use quick fixes without planning proper solution
- Ignore error messages or warnings
- Copy-paste code without understanding

### **‚úÖ Do This Instead**
- Create feature branches for all changes
- Ensure code works before pushing
- Fix CI/CD issues before merging
- Make small, focused commits
- Test thoroughly before pushing
- Plan proper solutions even when using quick fixes
- Address all warnings and errors
- Understand code before implementing

## üìö **Documentation Standards**

### **Code Documentation**
- **Comment Complex Logic**: Explain why, not what
- **Document APIs**: Include parameters, return values, examples
- **Update README**: Keep project documentation current
- **Version Changes**: Document breaking changes clearly

### **Process Documentation**
- **Record Decisions**: Document architectural decisions
- **Track Issues**: Maintain issue logs with solutions
- **Share Knowledge**: Help other contributors learn
- **Update Standards**: Improve these standards based on experience

## üéØ **Success Metrics**

### **Quality Metrics**
- **Zero Direct Commits**: All changes go through PRs
- **High Test Coverage**: Maintain >80% test coverage
- **Fast CI/CD**: Keep pipeline under 10 minutes
- **Low Bug Rate**: Few regressions from changes

### **Process Metrics**
- **Quick Issue Resolution**: Address problems within 24 hours
- **Efficient Reviews**: PR reviews completed within 48 hours
- **Stable Deployments**: Successful deployments >95% of the time
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Regular documentation updates

## üöÄ **Continuous Improvement**

### **Regular Reviews**
- **Weekly**: Review development practices
- **Monthly**: Update these standards
- **Quarterly**: Assess overall development efficiency
- **Annually**: Major process improvements

### **Feedback Loop**
- **Learn from Mistakes**: Document and learn from failures
- **Share Best Practices**: Help other contributors improve
- **Adapt Processes**: Modify workflows based on team needs
- **Stay Current**: Keep up with industry best practices
