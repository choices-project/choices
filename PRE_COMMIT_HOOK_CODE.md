## Key Features

### Security Checks
1. **JWT Token Detection** - Blocks commits with JWT-like patterns
2. **Hardcoded Credentials** - Prevents API keys and secrets in code
3. **Database URLs** - Blocks connection strings with passwords
4. **File Type Restrictions** - Prevents credential files from being committed
5. **Environment Variables** - Blocks hardcoded env var assignments

### Code Quality Checks
1. **ESLint Integration** - Runs linting on TypeScript/JavaScript files
2. **Commit Message Format** - Suggests conventional commit format
3. **TODO/FIXME Detection** - Warns about unfinished work

### User Experience
1. **Colored Output** - Clear visual feedback with colors
2. **Helpful Messages** - Provides suggestions for fixing issues
3. **Interactive Prompts** - Asks for confirmation on log files
4. **Detailed Error Reporting** - Shows exactly what was found and where

## Current Issue

The hook was previously blocking commits because of JWT-like fallback tokens in CI workflows. This has been resolved by using non-JWT-like fallback tokens:

```yaml
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: ${{ secrets.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY || 'fake-dev-key-for-ci-only' }}
```

The improved hook now includes a NEXT_PUBLIC_* allowlist to prevent false positives for public environment variables.
