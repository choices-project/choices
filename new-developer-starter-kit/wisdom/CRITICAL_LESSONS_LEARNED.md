**Lesson**: Enable Row Level Security on all tables.

**Why It Matters**:
- Prevents unauthorized access
- Protects user data
- Ensures compliance
- Maintains data integrity

**Our Experience**:
- **Before**: No RLS ‚Üí Data exposure risks, compliance issues
- **After**: Comprehensive RLS ‚Üí Secure, compliant data access

**Action**: Enable RLS on all tables and implement appropriate policies.

## üöÄ **Performance Lessons**

### **11. Monitor Performance Continuously**
**Lesson**: Monitor database and application performance from day one.

**Why It Matters**:
- Catches issues early
- Prevents user experience problems
- Optimizes resource usage
