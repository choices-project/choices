**Action**: 
- Import specific functions: `import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'` instead of `import * as React from 'react'`
- Remove unused imports immediately
- Use ESLint rules to catch unused imports
- Review imports regularly during development

### **17. Never Leave Console.log in Production**
**Lesson**: Remove all console.log statements before deploying to production.

**Why It Matters**:
- Providers (like Supabase) flag console.log as warnings
- Affects performance and security
- Creates noise in production logs
- Can expose sensitive information
- Professional code should be clean

**Our Experience**:
- **Before**: Console.log statements everywhere ‚Üí Supabase warnings, performance issues, security concerns

- Ensures proper server-side rendering
- Maintains good user experience
- Follows Next.js best practices

**Our Experience**:
- **Before**: Direct useSearchParams usage ‚Üí Hydration warnings, SSR issues
- **After**: Proper Suspense boundaries ‚Üí Clean rendering, no warnings

**Action**: 
- Wrap useSearchParams components in Suspense
- Provide fallback UI for loading states
- Test SSR and hydration thoroughly
- Follow Next.js App Router patterns

### **19. Fix Problems, Don't Bypass Checks**
**Lesson**: Never disable or weaken quality checks to avoid fixing issues.

**Why It Matters**:
- Checks exist because we've learned they prevent real problems
- Bypassing checks leads to technical debt accumulation
- Quality standards should be enforced, not avoided
- Root cause fixes are always better than workarounds

**Our Experience**:
- **Before**: Disabling ESLint rules, ignoring warnings ‚Üí Production issues, technical debt
- **After**: Fixing root causes, maintaining standards ‚Üí Clean code, fewer production issues

**Action**: 
- Always fix the underlying issue, not the check
- Use proper logging instead of console.log
- Implement proper error handling instead of ignoring errors
- Maintain quality standards consistently
- Only adjust checks when they're too broad or incorrect

### **20. Never Use select('*') - Always Select Specific Fields**
**Lesson**: Always select only the specific database fields you need, never use `select('*')`.

**Why It Matters**:
- Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive data (passwords, tokens, etc.)
- Improves query performance by reducing data transfer
- Makes code more explicit about data requirements
- Follows principle of least privilege
- Security providers flag this as a critical issue

**Our Experience**:
- **Before**: `select('*')` everywhere ‚Üí Potential data exposure, performance issues, security warnings
- **After**: Specific field selection ‚Üí Secure, performant, explicit code

**Action**: 
- Replace `select('*')` with specific field lists
- Create field mapping configurations for different tables
- Use automated scripts to find and fix instances
- Add CI checks to prevent future usage
- Always think about what data is actually needed

**Example**: 
```typescript
// ‚ùå BAD - Could expose sensitive data
const { data: user } = await supabase
  .from('ia_users')
  .select('*')
  .eq('id', userId)
  .single()

// ‚úÖ GOOD - Only selects needed fields
const { data: user } = await supabase
  .from('ia_users')
  .select('id, email, verification_tier, created_at, updated_at')
  .eq('id', userId)
  .single()
```
