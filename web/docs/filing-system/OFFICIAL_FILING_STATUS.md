## ⚖️ Legal Reality Check

### **What Election Authorities Require:**

**Federal (FEC):**
- Must file via FEC eFiling portal or FECFile software
- **No public API for filing** (only for lookup/verification)
- Must use official channels for submission

**States:**
- Varies dramatically
- Some have APIs (California, Texas, Florida)
- Many require paper forms or in-person filing
- Each state has different requirements

### **Our Approach:**
1. **Where APIs exist** → Direct integration (California, etc.)
2. **Where APIs don't exist** → Form generation + guided submission
3. **Always verify** → Check official databases to confirm filing
