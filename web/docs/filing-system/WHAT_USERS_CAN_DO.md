## 💡 The Reality Check

### **Why Not Direct Filing Everywhere?**

**Federal (FEC):**
- ❌ **No public API for filing** - FEC only provides lookup/verification API
- ⚠️ Must use FEC eFiling portal or FECFile software
- ✅ **BUT:** We can verify instantly via FEC API (working now!)

**States:**
- ✅ **Some have APIs:** California, Texas, Florida (can integrate)
- ❌ **Many don't have APIs:** New York, many others (must guide users)
- ⚠️ Each state is different

**Solution:**
- Where APIs exist → Direct filing (building toward this)
- Where APIs don't exist → Form generation + guided submission (next phase)
