/**
 * React Hook Utilities
 * 
 * Note: These utility functions have been removed in favor of direct React hook usage
 * to maintain proper dependency tracking and ESLint compliance.
 * 
 * Use React hooks directly in your components with explicit dependency arrays:
 * - useCallback(fn, [dep1, dep2])
 * - useMemo(() => value, [dep1, dep2])
 * - useEffect(() => { effect }, [dep1, dep2])
 * 
 * This approach provides better maintainability and prevents dependency-related bugs.
